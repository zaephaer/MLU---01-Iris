# MLU-01-Iris-Classification

**About**<br>
The best-known example in the field of machine learning. The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species. 

**Dataset**<br>
 The data source is the file iris_flowers.csv. It contains the data for this example in comma-separated values (CSV) format. The number of columns is 5, and the number of rows is 150.

The variables are:
- sepal_length: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.
- sepal_width: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.
- petal_length: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.
- petal_width: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.
- class: Iris Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, used as the target.


**Objective**<br>
- to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements. 
- to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers.
